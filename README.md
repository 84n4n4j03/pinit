# PinIt
Tired of typing an often used or long command? Pin it!


## What's PinIt ?
A simplistic way to collect, organize and fire actions.

It consists of only two kind of things:
* menus
* buttons

A button can do only three things:
* open another menu
* do an action
* change the current working directory

An action is a command executed on the owning command line.
This way you can hook programs, apps, scripts, tools, complicated calls,
browser+webpages ... whatever that can be executed on the command line.
(Using the "cd" command to change a directory will not work, because python
executes the action command in a subprocess, hence the extra button type:
directory)

The layout can be extended with a few clicks, with further nested submenus
and/or actions, be stored or even be scripted.


## Installation
PinIt was written using python3. So you should have it available on your system^^.
Either clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/84n4n4j03/pinit.git`
or download the [archive](https://github.com/84n4n4j03/pinit/archive/master.zip).


## Usage
In the root directory simply say `python pinit.py`
and a small GUI with colored buttons should open. Submenus open on mouse
hovering and can be pinned on mouse click. All menus are always on top. Open
the config menu to add new buttons.


## Tricks
### savedLayout.js
The layout is stored into a file named savedLayout.js. As the extension implies
it's human readable json and can be directly tweaked. When you start PinIt the
first time you'll get an empty menu. When you save it, it is stored next to the
main directory.
(Hint: this way it's outside the PinIt repo and can be stored with a parent
repo, in case you use PinIt as sub repo).
To start from scratch you can simply delete it and start pinit.
The structure is easy to understand and after you get used to it you can
quickly add, modify, and delete stuff.

You could even remove the configuration and storage capablities this way to
write protect a menu.

If you want PinIt to use another layout file you can specify it on start, like
so: `python pinit --layout path/to/yourFile.js`.
This way you can also open the exampleLayout.js stored in the root directory of
PinIt.

### Parameter
To use an action with different parameter simply add a "$" in front of a word
in the command. If you click the button another menu shows up to ask you for
the actual value. E.g.: `git checkout $branch` will ask you for the value
of `$branch`. Of course you can do this for multiple parameters.

### Blocking commands
Some calls may block the further execution until they're finished. E.g. a
command `notepad aFile.txt` opens aFile.txt in notepad but the button stucks in
the pressed state until notepad is closed. Sometimes this is a desired
behaviour but if not you could try the command "start" before your actual call.
So the example before would end up in `start notepad aFile.txt`. This only
triggers the command and directly returns.

### Directory
The `Â§pinit` variable to contains the root directory of your pinit repo, so you
can use it to navigate relatively to it. Of course you can use environment
variables too.

## Limitations
I needed it on Windows machines, and some code related to window focussing
will not run on other platforms. Though this could easily be adapted (e.g.
by extracting a base class from `misc/windowmgr.py` and inherit both the existing
Windows implementation and your new target platform implementation, finally
add some logic to switch between both based on the platform you're running on).
